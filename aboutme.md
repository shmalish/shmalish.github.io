Hello I hope you are well. I decided to create a blog page because I like learning about new things and then teaching people about what I've learnt.

- I like health and fitness: This blog page will cover how to stay fit regardless of gender, age, ethnicity or anything else. I aim to write blog posts around sports and longevity in a way that is accessible, affordable and applicable to anyone and everyone. 
- I like programming - This blog page will also cover any programming projects I am working on. I am to make the code legible and easy to understand. I am not the best of programmers so if there is a better way to do something, please let me know. 
- I like cooking - Unfortunately I will not be uploading my secret recipes on this blog page. 
- I like making music - Follow me on soundcloud. 
If you are wondering why my logo says malivorian, I got chatgpt to make a cool sounding username for me
