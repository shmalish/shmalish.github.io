# Introduction
The reason for this blog is to share tips on how to become more muscular regardless of age, gender, nationality or diet preference. Whether you are losing or gaining weight, the content in this blog may apply to you. The reason why muscle is important is because it is a very big indicator for quality of life when you are older. The more muscle mass you have (to an extent) the lower your mortality rate. 

# Pre requisites
Before I go into what to do in the gym, it's very important to talk about what to do outside of the gym. 
1) Make sure to get plenty of sleep if your aims are to build muscle mass (7-9 hours). Remember that Growth Hormone is as anabolic as testosterone for building muscle.
2) Make sure to consume plenty of protein. You want to aim for 0.8-1g of protein per kg of body weight. If your body fat is on the higher side (25%+ for men and 35%+ for women) then you get your goal weight and base your protein intake based on that i.e if I weigh 100kg and my goal weight is 80kg, I would consume 80 grams of protein instead of 100. 
3) Make sure to try lower your stress. 
4) Do not neglect cardio. Do lots of walking, running, cycling etc.
5) 5g creatine a day for the rest of your life

## Finding Maintainance calories
Your maintainance calories is the amount your body needs to keep your weight exactly the same. Calories over maintainance will make you gain weight and vice versa. One good way of doing it is using one of the online calorie calculators to find your maintainance. Then for a week eat at exactly those calories and track your weight every single day. If you lose weight then increase 200 calories. If you gain weight then decrease 200 calories. Repeat process until you stay basically the same weight. 

One tip I have done is switch out snacks for fruit. I eat about 3 apples, 3 dates and 1-2 bannanas every single day during my cut. This is much healthier compared to what I was doing before which was yamming on Squares bars and cupcakes. Volume is king. I also eat some rice cakes from time to time.

To cut out sugar, I replaced it with SweetX or sodium saccharin. This to me tastes way sweeter than sugar so I have it in my morning coffee (-32 calories by replacing 2 teaspoons of sugar). Assuming I have coffee with milk and sugar 2x a day, sodium saccharin saves me 64 calories a day. I understand cutting out ultra processed sugar is very difficult but after a while you don't really care. 


# Gym 
## Bulking 
Bulking is great because you get very strong and build muscle very quickly. This is because your body can spend the excess calories on things like testosterone, growth hormone, insulin and supercharge the mTor pathway. But if you consume too many calories you will become mega fat. This was a mistake I made and while I got super muscular very quickly, I also got super fat. 

If you're going to bulk, aim for a "lean" bulk. Try aim for 200 extra calories every day above your maintainance. At a certain point the extra 200 calories will become your maintainance due to the increased muscle and fats so slowly you can increase it to 300-400ish. If you find while you're on your bulk you aren't getting stronger try to consume more protein and carbohydrates. Remember that 20-30% of your calories should be fats for hormone health. Carbs are important for motor unit recruitment while training. Protein is what builds the muscle.Your "bulk" should last about 4 months but you don't want to gain 15%-20% body fat. The second you're about 15-18% body fat you want to start cutting again.   

When on a bulk, I find Push, Pull, Legs is the best split because you have the necessary calories to recover quickly and can therefore gain more muscle on a very high volume plan. Alternatively you can also do upper/lower if you feel you want the extra recovery days.

## Cutting
I hold the opinion that you should cut as slowly as possible if you want to maintain the muscle you've grown. It's possible to go more aggressive but for me personally my hormones crash whenever I put my calories too low. No more than 400 calories a day and stop if you feel your hormones are crashing. If that happens, go back to maintainance for a week and do a 300 deficit.
