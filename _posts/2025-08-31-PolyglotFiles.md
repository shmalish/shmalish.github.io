# Introduction 
If you know me, you know I'm obsessed with how I look and I'm always trying to be more muscular, lean and strong. The best thing about looking handsome is that I can make videos of just my face and have a tiktok page with 80% of my viewers being women. If you also know me, you know I like coding and learning and recently I learnt about polyglot files. In this blobpost, we'll see how a video of me can be a zip file, mp4 file and maybe in the future I'll update this page so it's also a pdf file.
