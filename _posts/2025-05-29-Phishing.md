# Introduction

For no reason whatsoever, I am doing some research into whether there is anything in the literature that has been done to address phishing and repeat clickers. I am not going to use any AI to write this because there's gonna be some weird neek on the internet going ðŸ¤“ "this was probably written by AI I don't need to read this". 



# Literature Review 

(Canham,2023) did a study on repeat clickers and protective stewards and told them to remember a code word at the beginning of the study that they would need to recall at the end. He found that all repeat clickers failed to remember the identifier whereas the protective stewards all remembered. At the end the researcher states "the inability to recall code words by repeat clickers combined with an inability to recall simulated phishing failures and rigid email habits are suggestive of an underlying common cognitive factor at play with repeat clickers. A potential reason that repeat clickers have more rigid habits is that they are compensating for a cognitive deficiency that is also contributing to less effective recall".The researcher also claims from previous work that "repeat clickers present nearly three times more risk to an organisations social engineering attack exposure than occasional clickers". The researcher gathered volunteers of repeat clickers and protective stewards and asked them to fill out an online survery to assess their anxiety in using the internet, detecting phishing emails and whether they have been victims of online fraud. They then did interviews which were on techniue and strategies, actions in response to a suspicious email, percieved technological prowess, phishing simulations and workload email habits. The researcher discovered that repeat clickers tend to hanve higher internet anxiety, higher locus of control and lower technical prowess. Both groups also had a similar level of workload and felt they were overworked. However, the researcher in this study references their previous work many times thus causing the potential of bias. The sample size of the group was also extrememly small (6) which is not reflective of a larger population.
